1. emitREADVAR(name, mtype, index, frame)
name: The name of the variable to be loaded (a string).

mtype: The data type of the variable to be loaded (an object of a subclass of Type).

index: The index of the variable in the local variable table of the current method (an integer).

frame: The Frame object representing the current method's activation record.

2. emitSTATIC(path, field, mtype, isput, frame)
path: The path to the class where the static field is declared (a string).

field: The name of the static field to be accessed (a string).

mtype: The data type of the static field to be accessed (an object of a subclass of Type).

isput: A boolean flag indicating whether the instruction is for accessing (False) or setting (True) the static field.

frame: The Frame object representing the current method's activation record.

3. emitADDOP(op, type, frame): Emits assembly code for adding two operands of the specified type using the operator op. The assembly code is emitted to the current frame.

4. emitMULOP(op, type, frame): Emits assembly code for multiplying two operands of the specified type using the operator op. The assembly code is emitted to the current frame.

5. emitNEGOP(type, frame): Emits assembly code for negating an operand of the specified type. The assembly code is emitted to the current frame.

6. emitCAST(type1, type2, frame): Emits assembly code for casting an operand from type1 to type2. The assembly code is emitted to the current frame.

7. emitPUSHICONST(val, frame): Emits assembly code for pushing an integer constant value val onto the stack. The assembly code is emitted to the current frame.

8. emitPUSHFCONST(val, frame): Emits assembly code for pushing a floating-point constant value val onto the stack. The assembly code is emitted to the current frame.

9. emitPUSHVAR(id, type, isLocal, frame): Emits assembly code for pushing the value of a variable with identifier id and type type onto the stack. The variable is either local or global based on the value of isLocal. The assembly code is emitted to the current frame.

10. emitPOP(type, frame): Emits assembly code for popping the top of the stack into a variable of type type. The assembly code is emitted to the current frame.
