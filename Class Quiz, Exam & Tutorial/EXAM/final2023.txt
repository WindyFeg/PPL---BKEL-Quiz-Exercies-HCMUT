PPL (Principles of Programming Languages) exam HK231:

Multiple Choice Section (30 questions - 6 point):

    Explain provided code snippets with some theoretical concepts.
    Discuss pass by value, reference, value-result
    Some Multiple choice about exception, coroutine   
    Converting -1.78 to binary code .
    Short-circuit evaluation.
    Differentiate between global x/non-local in Python.
    Discuss Type: (T1*T1) -> (T2).
    Organize data types: char-1, int-2, float-4.
    Answer questions related to emitter by filling in the blanks.
    Question about JVM code
    Questions about Python's dynamic type declaration.
    ...

Essay Section (2 Questions - 4 points):

    Question 1: Code Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) related to Assignment 2. Specifically:
        Program: Node EOF
        Node components: DL info Node* SM
        info: NAME COLOR SM
        NAME: ...
        COLOR: ...

        Leaf() # name: str, color: str
        Binary() #name: str, color: str, Left: node, right: node
        MultiTree() #name: str, color: str, Left: node, middle:[node], right: node

        Explanation: If there's no node, it's a leaf. With one or two nodes, it's a binary tree. Three or more nodes create a multi-tree structure. Illustrate an AST.

    Question 2: In-depth discussion regarding Error Handling in Assignment 3:
        Program structure: decl EOF
        Decl components: classdecl, vdecl
        ...

        Error handling for:
        a) Redeclare errors for classes, variables, and fields.
        b) Error handling for static access, field access.
